## [TODO] Dependencies

- the gnu avr toolchain
- python 3
  - pyyaml `sudo pip install pyyaml`
  - markdown `sudo pip install markdown`


## Coding Conventions

### Comments
`/** ... */` comments are to be written in YAML, so they can be processed by
external tools to generate documentation, and for other purposes.

* When read the following will be stripped:
    * The first line (typically `/**`)
    * The last line (typically ` */`)
    * The first two characters of each line (typically ` *`)

* All elements are optional.
* All list elements are repeatable.
* All of these elements may all be specified from within any scanned file.
* Some of these elements have defaults (commented below); giving them a value
  explicitly will override that.
* The element `.ignore` may appear in any list, and should be ignored.
