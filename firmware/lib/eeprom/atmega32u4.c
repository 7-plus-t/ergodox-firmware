 * Implements the EEPROM interface defined in "../eeprom.h" for the ATMega32U4
 *
 * These functions (and most of the comments) are taken more or less straight
 * from the data sheet, section 5.3
 *
 * Assumptions
 * - Voltage will never fall below the specified minimum for the clock
 *   frequency being used.
 * - The address passed as `address` to any of the functions is valid.
 * - A write to flash memory (PROGMEM) will never be in progress when any of
 *   these functions are called.
 *
 * Warnings:
 * - These functions are *not* reentrant (i.e. they must never be called within
 *   an interrupt unless all calls to these functions are protected by having
 *   interrupts disabled for the duration of the call).
