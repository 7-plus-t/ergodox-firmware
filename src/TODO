- change stuff to correspond with the PCB Fredrik made
  - rows 0..6, cols 0..13

- write macros so that either rows or columns can be the driving pins (macro
  should be set in the keyboard/.../controller folder somewhere, i think)
  - set them by default to match the direction of keyswitch internal diodes; if
    fredrik or dominic put theirs together differently first, i can change the
    default to match theirs

- write the python script for Ben, to extract all that useful stuff from the
  .map file and comments

- then i'll think about how to implement variable length arrays, and write some

- then i'll think about how to use them as stacks, to deal with layer issues

- implement the dvorak layout (see github issue)
