# Documentation : layout

Different layouts are included by modifying a variable in the makefile.

To write a new one:
* You must implement everything defined in [layout.h] (layout.h).  Take a look
  at existing layouts.
* The number of layers must be defined in the layout *.h file.
* Use `0` for no-operation (unused) keys, and `NULL` for no-operation (unused)
  functions.
* See [matrix.md] (matrix.md) for how the key matrix maps to hardware.
* See [keyboard-usage-page--short-names.h]
  (../../lib/_usb/keyboard-usage-page--short-names.h) for available keycodes.
* See [key-functions.c] (../../key-functions.c) for what functions keys can
  call.


## notes

* Assuming 560 bytes for everything else in RAM space, there's 2000 bytes left
  for the layout.  This should be enough for about 7 layers.  Watch your RAM
  usage if you're getting close.

  * The layout matricies could be moved to flash memory (program space, instead
    of data space) in order to save RAM, but that doesn't seem necessary at the
    moment.  It would also be slightly slower, though that probably shouldn't
    be a concern.  It might be necessary (or convenient) if one were trying to
    implement on-keyboard remaping.
