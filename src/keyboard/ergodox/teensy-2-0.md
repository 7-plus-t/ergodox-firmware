* notes:
  * SCL and SDA: Need external pull-up resistors.  Sometimes the Teensy
    internal pull-ups are enough (see datasheet section 20.5.1), but i think
    for this project we'll want external ones.  The general recommendation for
    400kHz I&sup2;C seems to be 2.2kÎ©.


## Notes about Registers

### General I/O (see datasheet section 10.2.1)

    DDRxn  function  PORTxn  function
    1      output    1       drive high
                     0       drive low
    0      input     1       internal pull-up on
                     0       internal pull-up off

    PINxn  action   function
           write 1  toggles the value of PORTxn
           read     returns the logical value (1|0) of the pin

* notes:
  * Unused pins should be set as input, with internal pullup enabled in order
    to give them a defined level (see datasheet section 10.2.6).
  * PD6 (the onboard LED) already has a defined level (low), so there's no
    reason to set internal pull-up enabled on it.  If we do, it will source
    current to the LED, which is fine, but unnecessary.
  * We want the row pins 'hi-Z' initially (set as input with pull-up disabled),
    and the column pins set as input with internal pull-up enabled.  We'll
    cycle through driving the row pins low (setting them as output) and
    checking the column pins in the update function.
    * Switching the row pins between hi-Z and drive low (treating them as if
      they were open drain) seems just as good as, and a little safer than,
      driving them high when the row's not active.

### PWM on ports OC1(A|B|C) (see datasheet section 14.10)

* notes: settings:
  * PWM pins should be set as outputs.
  * we want Waveform Generation Mode 5  
    (fast PWM, 8-bit)  
    (see table 14-5)
    * set `TCCRB[4,3],TCCRA[1,0]` to `0,1,0,1`
  * we want "Compare Output Mode, Fast PWM" to be `0b10`  
    "Clear OCnA/OCnB/OCnC on compare match, set OCnA/OCnB/OCnC at TOP"  
    (see table 14-3)  
    this way higher values of `OCR1(A|B|C)` will mean longer 'on' times for the
    LEDs (provided they're hooked up to GND; other way around if they're hooked
    up to Vcc)
    * when in a fast PWM mode, set `TCCR1A[7,6,5,4,3,2]` to `1,0,1,0,1,0`
  * we want "Clock Select Bit Description" to be `0b001`  
    "clkI/O/1 (No prescaling)"  
    (see table 14-6)
    * set `TCCR1B[2,1,0]` to `0,0,1`
    * LEDs will be at minimum brightness until OCR1(A|B|C) are changed (since
      the default value of all the bits in those registers is 0)

* notes: behavior:
  * The pins source current when on, and sink current when off.  They aren't
    set to high impediance for either.
  * In Fast PWM mode setting `OCR1(A|B|C)` to `0` does not make the output on
    `OC1(A|B|C)` constant low; just close.  Per the datasheet, this isn't true
    for every PWM mode.

* abbreviations:
  * OCR = Output Compare Register
  * TCCR = Timer/Counter Control Register
